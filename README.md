Hi!
This is my pet-project. I created it to win a joke game with friends and for skill training.

## What is it?

This program must search words in dictionary by the first letter of the word and the set of letters that are included in this word.
### For example:
Your friend made a riddle - "guess the word that starts with 'A' and and includes letters 'p', 'l', 'p'".
You can make a request "Aplp" for my program and get an answer in the form of a list of words that match the conditions:
- apple
- application
- apply
- approval
- etc.
